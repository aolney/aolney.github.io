Join us at The University of Memphis for an **online** interdisciplinary summer internship program in data science! 

The DataWhys Project at The University of Memphis is developing a training program for LeMoyne-Owen College students outside the core data science fields of statistics, machine learning, and computer science. As part of this internship, interns will use and provide feedback on this training program and complete an original data science research project—no background in data science is needed! 

Along the way, interns will work closely with faculty and graduate student mentors to develop their data science and professional skills, including how to research a topic, how to read a scientific paper, how to find a dataset, and how to present results.  

Accepted interns will be paid $14/hr. and are expected to attend **online** from 10–4pm, Monday through Thursday (with an hour for lunch), from May 31, 2021 to July 23, 2021. The program is limited to 15 students, so priority will be given to students closer to graduation. Applicants must be students at LeMoyne-Owen College and eligible to work in the U.S.  

Students should apply online at <https://forms.gle/eAdR1C1GDwtgQymT9>. Applications will close at 11:59 PM CST on April 12, 2021. Each application should be supported by two letters of reference emailed to Andrew Olney (aolney@memphis.edu). Decision notifications will be sent out at the end of April. 

The DataWhys Project and internship are supported by the National
Science Foundation through Grant 1918751 for to the University of
Memphis.
