Here is a brief video introduction to the Fable Jupyterlab Blockly Extension with a data science example using the Iris dataset. 

The video also showcases intellisense-driven blocks (intelliblocks). Intelliblocks reconfigure the blocks using intellisense, effectively generating blocks to call members (properties or methods) on Python objects. Because intellisense comes from the kernel, the blocks cannot configure themselves until the code has been executed on the kernel. That is why there are more single-statement code cells (particularly for imports) than you would normally see in a Python program.

My [Fable Jupyterlab Blockly Extension](https://olney.ai/category/2019/12/27/jupyterlabblockly.html) now has intelliblocks - blocks that use intellisense to call properties and functions on any Python library.
