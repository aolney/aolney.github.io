A [JupyterLab extension that offers StarChat LLM support](https://github.com/aolney/jupyterlab-starchat-extension) compatible with JupyterLab 1.2.x, and a matching [Docker service providing StarChat.](https://github.com/aolney/starchat-service)

LLMs for programming are a relatively hot area, so we thought we would explore integrating these directly into JupyterLab. 
The interface requires the user to type a complete prompt, and in our early testing, we found that naive users were unable to write useful prompts.
In our future work we will explore stored prompts with direct UI integration rather than a separate chat widget.
