Cierra Thornton worked with me as an intern last summer, building a web appliation for finding appropriate reviewers given a set of keywords or abstract from a paper needing review. 

Today she presented her project at the [16th Annual TLSAMP Undergraduate Research Conference](http://www.tnstate.edu/tlsamp/research_conference2019.aspx).
