Meng Cao has completed her Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology!

Her dissertation, titled ``Exploring the Effects of Category Similarity, Spacing, and Block
Size on Category Learning," explored the effects of interleaving, blocking, and category similarity (both between and within) on category learning, specifically of bird species. Meng found that interleaving is always superior to blocking, and that spacing was also beneficial. Category similarity affected generalizability, with low similarity stimuli having high practice accuracy but low novel accuracy, with high similarity stimuli following the opposite pattern.

**Meng was hired into a [postdoc position at CMU](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/meng-cao) after graduation!**
