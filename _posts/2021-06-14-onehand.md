To help resolve my typing issues, I've switched to a Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard with a magic trackpad on top, as shown [here](https://www.petekeen.net/mounting-a-magic-trackpad-on-a-kinesis-advantage-keyboard).

This seems to be working pretty well, though I had to adjust the keymap quite a bit  to take the work off my right pinky, which isn't recovering as quickly as the rest of my hand. If you are not familiar with the concept of remapping keys, that means that you can make any key perform the function of another key.

Using "Kp Shift", I can avoid using my pinky at all; I assume someone could do a similar mapping if they were missing/could not use another finger. In case it helps someone else, I'm sharing the keymap below.
