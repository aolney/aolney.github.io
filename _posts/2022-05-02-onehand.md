I've lost the use of my right hand for computer input as a result of tendonitis (still self diagnosed), again. New and improved method of glide typing on Ubuntu shown in the video below.

This resolves all the UI glitches [of my first post](https://olney.ai/category/2021/04/25/onehand.html) in terms of mouse buttons not working through the mouse pen and double clicking of keys. 
However it is very sensitive to double click speed, which must be done "just right"
