Jessica Gatewood has completed her Ed.D. in Instruction and Curriculum Leadership!

Her dissertation, titled ``A Causal-Comparative Study of Novices and Experts Testing
Nielsen's Five User Assumption within a Learning Technology," challenged the widely known Nielsen assumption that only five participants are needed to identify 80% of usability problems. Jessica's study recruited five experts and five novices to identify learning experience design (cf. UX) problems with an educational technology platform.  Experience  affected identification and classification of problems, such that for novices were better able to detect certain types of problems than experts - in fact, novices met Nielsens 80% assumption but experts did not.
