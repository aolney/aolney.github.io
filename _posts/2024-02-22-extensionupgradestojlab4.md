We have upgraded our JupyterLab Blockly extensions for [Python](https://github.com/aolney/jupyterlab-blockly-python-extension) and [R](https://github.com/aolney/jupyterlab-blockly-r-extension) to JupyterLab 4.x

Thes JupyterLab extensions add [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) support to [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#). 
Blockly is a visual programming language primarily designed to teach coding.
JupyterLab is a computational notebook environment widely used in data science as well as many scientific fields.

These extensions also add *intelliblocks*. Intelliblocks are Blockly blocks that *self-configure* based on loaded libraries.
This means you can load a library and immediately access everything in it using Blockly. 
Intelliblocks essentially automatically author Blockly blocks, which otherwise would need to be manually defined.
