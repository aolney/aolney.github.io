Join us at The University of Memphis for an interdisciplinary summer internship program in data science!

The DataWhys Project at The University of Memphis is developing a training program for students outside the core data science fields of statistics, machine learning, and computer science. As part of this internship, interns will use and provide feedback on this training program and complete an original data science research project—no background in data science is needed!

Along the way, interns will work closely with faculty and graduate student mentors to develop their data science and professional skills, including how to research a topic, how to read a scientific paper, how to find a dataset, and how to present results. 

Accepted interns will be paid $18/hr. and are expected to attend from 10–4:30pm, Monday through Friday from June 2, 2024 to July 3, 2025. The internship will take place at the Fedex Institute of Technology on the University of Memphis campus from June 2 to June 20 and will be remote for the remainder of the internship.

The program is limited to 15 students. We particularly encourage students from regional HBCUs, community colleges, and recent high school graduates. Interns must be 18 or older and eligible to work in the U.S. Support is available for interns who need temporary accommodation for the on-site portion of the internship as well as travel assistance.

Students should apply online at https://forms.gle/eAdR1C1GDwtgQymT9. Acceptance decisions will be made on a rolling basis until applications close at 11:59 PM CST on March 28, 2025. Competitive applications will be supported by two letters of reference emailed to Andrew Olney (aolney@memphis.edu). Decision notifications for applications received March 29th will be sent out April 4th.

The DataWhys Project and internship are supported by the National Science Foundation through Grant 1918751 to the University of Memphis.
