Luiz and I presented a workshop at the [SIGCSE Technical Symposium](https://sigcse2024.sigcse.org/program/program-sigcse-ts-2024/?date=Sat%2023%20Mar%202024) in Portland Oregon.

The workshop was an interesting blend of his work on [Blockly-DS](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3576050.3576097) and our blocks extension for JupyterLab.
For the workshop, Luiz used our platform (TLJH with [JupyterLab Blockly extension for Python](https://github.com/aolney/jupyterlab-blockly-python-extension)) and then blended his training materials with [some of our own](https://github.com/memphis-iis/datawhys-content-notebooks-python) on the same topics.

The audience was about half higer-ed educators (i.e. data science course instructors) and half researchers interested in the blocks approach.
We had some good discussion and generated ideas for the future, so it was a good workshop!
