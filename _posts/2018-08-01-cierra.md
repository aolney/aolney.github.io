Cierra Thornton has worked with me as an intern this summer, building a web appliation for finding appropriate reviewers given a set of keywords or abstract from a paper needing review. Today she presented her project at the [LeMoyne-Owen College](https://www.loc.edu/) undergraduate research event.
