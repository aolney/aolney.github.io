Jackie Maass has defended her Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology!

I've had the good fortune of collaborating with her on several papers investigating concept maps and learning like [this](https://www.andrewmolney.name/category/2017/06/27/aiedcloze.html) and [this](https://www.andrewmolney.name/category/2014/01/01/Cade-W-Maass-J-Hays-P-Olney-A.html).

Her dissertation looked at how the testing effect varied with example vs. definition questions, either blocked or paired. Looks like pairing examples before definitions is a good idea!

This fall, Jackie will be starting as an Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of 
Central Oklahoma.
