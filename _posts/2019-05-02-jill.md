I was paired with Jill Johnson in the CBU Odyssey Mentoring Program this semester.

They don't seem to have it up on the web, but it's a very cool program that helps juniors figure out their best career options by pairing them with mentors in the appropriate fields.

Jill and I were paired on A.I. and had many good conversations about cognitive science, A.I., and neuroscience over the last few months. She is no doubt a rising star.
