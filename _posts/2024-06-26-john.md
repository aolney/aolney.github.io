John Hollander has completed his Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology!

His dissertation, titled ``Sensorimotor Grounding in Novel Word Acquisition," investigates embodied effects on language learning when concepts are relatively novel vs. when they are new labels for existing concepts. Across three experiments, he finds that embodied effects are most prominent for novel concepts. When learning labels for existing concepts, it appears embodied effects during learning of a new label are overshadowed by existing embodied effects from learning the concept.

**John was hired directly into a tenure-track Assistant Professor position at [Arkansas State](https://www.astate.edu) after graduation!**
