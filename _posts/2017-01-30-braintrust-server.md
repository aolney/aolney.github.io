The server component of BrainTrust is [now on GitHub](https://github.com/aolney/braintrust-server).

Like the [BrainTrust client](https://github.com/aolney/braintrust-electron), the server component is written with [Fable](http://fable.io/) and leverages Node. As a result, it is more straightfoward to shift load between the client and server, e.g. collapse them into a single desktop application or turn the Electron client into a web page.
