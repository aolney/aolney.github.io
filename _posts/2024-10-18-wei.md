Wei Chu has completed her Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology!

Her dissertation, titled ``Exploring the Impact Of Initial Learning Degree and Meaningfulness on the Rate of Forgetting in Paired Associates Learning," explored the effects of degree of initial learning and meaningfulness of materials on forgetting in memory. Wei found that noun-noun pairs with high meaningfulness exhibit superior long-term retention performance, a slower absolute rate of forgetting, and a slower relative rate of forgetting. While a higher degree of initial learning led to better long-term performance due to better learning initially, it did not significantly reduce the rate of forgetting, supporting the independence hypothesis regarding the initial learning degree and forgetting rate.
