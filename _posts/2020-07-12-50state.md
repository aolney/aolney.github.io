As part of my volunteer work for the City of Memphis - Shelby County Joint COVID Task Force in the ESF 8 Data Subcommittee, I adapted the [ICL European non-pharmaceutical intervention model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7) to the U.S.

This work is now [published to the preprint server MedRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20151001v1) in order to make it available as quickly as possible to the scientific community (also at the bottom of this page):

Olney, A. M., Smith, J., Sen, S., Thomas, F., & Unwin, H. J. T. (2020). Estimating the Effect of Social Distancing Interventions on COVID-19 in the United States. MedRxiv, 2020.07.10.20151001. https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.10.20151001

Here's the short story:

<ul>
<li> Lockdown is the key intervention for bringing the virus under control (of those we tested) </li>
<li> If lockdown isn't replaced by other interventions that are cumulatively as effective, the virus will continue to spread </li>
</ul>

This work was featured in the [COVID-19 Lightning Talks at the FedEx Institute of Technology](https://www.memphis.edu/fedex/events/covid-19-lightning-talks.php):
