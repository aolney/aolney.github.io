As part of my volunteer work for the City of Memphis - Shelby County Joint COVID Task Force in the ESF 8 Data Subcommittee, I adapted the [ICL European non-pharmaceutical intervention model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7) to the U.S.

This work is now [published in the American Journal of Epidemiology](https://academic.oup.com/aje/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/aje/kwaa293/6066665):

Olney, A. M., Smith, J., Sen, S., Thomas, F., & Unwin, H. J. T. (2021). Estimating the Effect of Social Distancing Interventions on COVID-19 in the United States. American Journal of Epidemiology, 190(8), 1504â€“1509. https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaa293

Here's the short story:

<ul>
<li> Lockdown is the key intervention for bringing the virus under control (of those we tested) </li>
<li> If lockdown isn't replaced by other interventions that are cumulatively as effective, the virus will continue to spread </li>
</ul>

This work was featured in the [COVID-19 Lightning Talks at the FedEx Institute of Technology](https://www.memphis.edu/fedex/events/covid-19-lightning-talks.php):
