After teaching a semester class using Jupyter with our Blockly extension, as well as a summer boot camp in data science for the past 5 weeks, I think we've identified many of the key stumbling blocks with learning to use Jupyter and our Blockly extension.

This 1 hour tutorial goes step-by-step through both Jupyter and Blockly with particular emphasis on the places where people seem to get stuck.
