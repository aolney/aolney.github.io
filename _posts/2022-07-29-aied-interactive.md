We did an [interactive event](https://aied2022.webspace.durham.ac.uk/interactive-events/) on blocks programming at the 23rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education.

The video plus my abstract were reviewed for inclusion, but there is no associated publication or recording of the actual event.
