As part of our [DataWhys project](https://olney.ai/tags/datawhys.html), we have been collaborating with [Stan Pounds at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/directory/p/stan-pounds.html).

Stan is involved in multiple aspects of graduate education at St. Jude, and has part of that, he has created a set of R scripts that simplify the use of common R tasks down to a single function call.

For example, `grade=describe("Grade",nki70)` will, for the `Grade` variable of the `nki70` dataset:

- Create a plot of the appropriate type (in this case a bar chart with a bar for each level of the categorical variable and height equal to the $n$ of that level)
- Create a table with $n$ and percents for those variables
- Output a textual description of the results, i.e. "The categorical variable Grade has 144 observations: 48 Poorly diff (33.33%), 55 Intermediate (38.19%), 41 Well diff (28.47%)."

This is quite an interesting high level interface to `R` and in several ways, it overlaps/matches some of our project goals for creating a high level blocks programming language.

Over the past 9 months, our team has worked with Stan to migrate these scripts to a CRAN compliant `R` package. Although the package is not currently under review by CRAN, you can install it from GitHub with the following command:

```
devtools::install_github("stan-pounds/sbp")
```

These functions work seemlessly with our [JupyterLab Blockly R extension](https://github.com/aolney/jupyterlab-blockly-r-extension) and so create a goal-level blocks language for R - one that can be combined seemlessly with lower level blocks. 
A potential pedagogical approach for future work would be to transition students from goal-level blocks to a standard-R-level blocks and then finally to code.
