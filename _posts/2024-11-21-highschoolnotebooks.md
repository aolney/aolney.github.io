We [converted our data science course in Python to the high school level](https://github.com/memphis-iis/datawhys-highschool-notebooks-python) (solutions [here](https://github.com/memphis-iis/datawhys-highschool-notebooks-solutions)).
This effort was led by Andrew Tawfik and Luiz Barboza.

The course is divided into 15 modules, all of which are worked example notebooks.
The worked examples show the solutions but ask students to recreate them with step by step directions to create the code.

The coverage of topics reflects what we've done in recent years in our summer internship.
We cut some topics in the internship to make room for a programming bootcamp and real-world project.

The notebooks are designed to be used with [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) but can be used without it.
Blockly is a visual programming language primarily designed to teach coding.
To make this work we had to [add R language support to Blockly](https://olney.ai/category/2021/11/05/jupyterblocklyr.html).

The course outline covers core data science topics with an emphasis on model building/machine learning topics:

-	Getting around 
-	Data science and the nature of data 
-	Plotting 
-	Descriptive Stats
-	Measures of association 
-	Clustering 
-	KNN classification 
-	KNN regression 
-	Simple linear regression 
-	Multiple linear regression 
-	Logistic regression 
-	N/A: Lasso 
-	Decision trees 
-	Regression trees 
-	Random forests 
-	N/A: Gradient boosting 
-	N/A: Support vector machines 
-	N/A: Naive Bayes 
-	Crossvalidation   
-	Data cleaning 

*Note: N/A indicates a topic that exists in our main data science course but has been dropped from this course*
