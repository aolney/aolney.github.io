I was given a Big Mouth Billy Bass as a gag gift.

I decided to modify it so that I could "puppet" it from a computer.

Eventually, this led to connecting it to AutoTutor, with speech recognition, for an embodied tutor fish.

[Here is the source code for the basic puppeting.](https://umdrive.memphis.edu/aolney/public/projects/bass/BassTTS.zip)

This same code can be used to puppet virtually any kind of novelty animatronic.

In this case I used a parallel port relay card, but there are many other possible ways to connect a PC to such an animatronic.
