Noah Coomer started working with me this semester and has been building a service combining [the mateplus semantic parser](https://github.com/microth/mateplus) and [the clulab everything else parser](https://github.com/clulab/processors).

Noah presented this work at the CS Department Research Day and the UoM Research Forum and won awards at both.
Congrats Noah!
