Sean Kugele has completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science!

His dissertation, titled ``Embodied, Simulation-Based Cognition: A Hybrid Approach," proposed a novel hybrid (modal/amodal) neurosymbolic implementation of the LIDA cognitive architecture. It was a real tour de force in cognitive science that spanned grounded perceptual learning, action selection and procedural learning, and simulation-based reasoning.

**Sean is now a [tenure-track Assistant Professor](https://www.rhodes.edu/bio/sean-kugele) at Rhodes College!**
