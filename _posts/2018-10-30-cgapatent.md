My first patent [has been awarded](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10108604B2/en).

The patent describes a method of using semantic parsing to extract conceptual graphs (concept maps) from text for the purpose of generating questions in an intelligent tutoring system.

We used this technique in the [Guru](https://olney.ai/category/2012/09/01/guru-overview.html) tutoring system to generate domain models and create tutorial dialogue.

Given the state of NLP at that time, we used a post-hoc manual correction process, which we have crowdsourced in the [BrainTrust](https://olney.ai/category/2013/09/01/braintrust-overview.html) system.

The patent was filed in 2010, so it took eight years to be awarded.
