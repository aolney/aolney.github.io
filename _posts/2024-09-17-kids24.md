We presented a workshop at the [Knowledge In Data Science (KIDS24) Symposium](https://web.cvent.com/event/EC5FE0C1-3DE2-410D-B863-7638BFBC3285) at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital!

The workshop was a blending of some of our basic R notebooks, the dplyr workshop from last year, and Luiz's SIGCSE workshop.
Materials for the workshop are [here](https://github.com/memphis-iis/datawhys-r-workshop-2024).

Luiz was the workshop instructor, and Hasan, Farshid, and I played a supporting role.
