We [converted our data science course in Python to R](https://github.com/memphis-iis/datawhys-content-notebooks-r).
The course is divided into 20 modules, split into a partial worked example and problem solving notebooks.

The partial worked examples don't show the solutions but rather give step by step directions to create the code.
The problem solving notebooks are largely isomorphic but don't include the directions.

The notebooks are designed to be used with [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) but can be used without it.
Blockly is a visual programming language primarily designed to teach coding.
To make this work we had to [add R language support to Blockly](https://olney.ai/category/2021/11/05/jupyterblocklyr.html).

The course outline covers core data science topics with an emphasis on model building/machine learning topics:
