AutoTutor is an intelligent tutoring system that teaches people by having a conversation with them.

It works with virtually no knowledge engineering: AutoTutor domains can be developed in a day, not weeks or months.

People improve by about a letter grade after interacting with AutoTutor in our experiments.

The AutoTutor web site is [here](http://www.autotutor.org/)
