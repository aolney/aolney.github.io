I'm stepping down as Editor in Chief of the [Journal of Educational Data Mining](https://www.educationaldatamining.org/JEDM/index.php/JEDM) and will be replaced by current Associate Editor, Agathe Merceron.
It's a great feeling to know that you will be succeeded by someone so knowledgeable and talented.

These past 5 years have been an adventure.
We migrated our journal management software to a hosted OJS solution, implemented a  comprehensive set of journal policies, started publishing regular issues twice a year on a consistent schedule, started assigning DOIs to all articles, and were accepted for indexing in Scopus.
I feel very fortunate to have worked with excellent Associate Editors at JEDM and will remain on as one in the near term.
