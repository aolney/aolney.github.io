This is the first course I've ever created, and it's the first with an IIS prefix.

I'm leaning on [Pencil Code](https://pencilcode.net/) to minimize the programming aspect and focus on the concepts.

IIS 1010 - Intro to Intelligent Systems (3) Understanding artificial and natural phenomena in fields like biology, psychology, neuroscience, economics, and engineering through computational concepts and practices. [(syllabus)](https://umdrive.memphis.edu/aolney/public/Teaching/iis1010-sp19.pdf)
