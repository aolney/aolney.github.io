It's a pain to record on an Ipad while you use other apps. I made a simple webpage that lets you get around this.

The idea is to mirror the camera to a web page and then use the built-in screen recording. If you want, you can make the webpage full screen for a pretty seamless output.

You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/aolney/webcam) and use it yourself [here](https://olney.ai/webcam/).
