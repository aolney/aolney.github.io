IIS 4/6511 - Introduction to Applied Computational Linguistics (3) Understand how to explore, model, and reason about linguistic data. Identify categories of linguistic
problems and apply and extend existing methods to address these problems. The course is intended for students with little or no programming experience from any major. Programming in the course will focus on libraries in Python rather than core algorithms (as in COMP 7/8780). [(syllabus)](https://blogs.memphis.edu/aolney/files/2024/10/4511-6511-syllabus.pdf)
