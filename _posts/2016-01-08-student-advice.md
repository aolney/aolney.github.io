### The short version
First, figure out what you want. Find people who have it and do what they've done.

### The long version
Graduate school is not like any other schooling you've ever had. The emphasis is on self-directed exploration and publishing of your results. If you don't have your own ideas, if you don't have the motivation to pursue them, if you are not interested in presenting them to your peers and getting honest criticism, grad school is probably not for you.

The **WORST** thing you can do is go to a school where you have no relationship with a professor, publish no papers, and finish as quickly as possible. You *might* get a job in industry that way, but no one in academia will take you seriously.

The **BEST** thing you can do is find a professor whose work you find exciting and would like to advance. Contact that professor to see if they are socially compatible, and go from there. In other words:

- Start with your interest
- Use that interest to select a professor
- Based on the above, apply to a school

A lot of people have weighed in on this topic. I particularly like the following:

- [Ryan Adams](https://omny.fm/shows/talking-machines/hosts-of-talking-machines-neil-lawrence-and-ryan-a)
- [Mark Johnson](https://web.science.mq.edu.au/~mjohnson/Grad-applicants.htm)
- [Ronald Azuma](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~azuma/hitch4.html)

And of course students can always come talk to me.
