This one is not actually about a one hand interface :) 

For those posts, see [here](https://olney.ai/tags/rsi.html). 

I switched to an [ErgoDox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/) keyboard about a year ago from the Kinesis Advantage I had been using.

They are very similar, but I decided that the ability to change the angle of the keyboard as well as the separation between hands was important enough to justify the switch.
I think it has helped my RSI, so I'd recommend it.

The good people at ZSA.io reached out to interview me regarding my experience, which you can [read about here](https://people.zsa.io/andrew-olney/).
