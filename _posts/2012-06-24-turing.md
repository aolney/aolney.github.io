Because of my work on the PKD Android, I was asked to make a conversational portrait of Alan Turing in honor of his 100th birthday. It was difficult from the standpoint that I only had two weeks and limited source material. The final version used a chatbot using ngrams and backed by Wikipedia for knowledge.

Here's the story:
