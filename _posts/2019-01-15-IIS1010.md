This is the first course I've ever created (as a new course in the catalogue), and it's the first with an IIS prefix.

I'm leaning on [Pencil Code](https://pencilcode.net/) to minimize the programming aspect and focus on the concepts.

IIS 1010 - Intro to Intelligent Systems (3) Understanding artificial and natural phenomena in fields like biology, psychology, neuroscience, economics, and engineering through computational concepts and practices. [(syllabus)](https://blogs.memphis.edu/aolney/files/2019/10/iis1010-sp19.pdf)
