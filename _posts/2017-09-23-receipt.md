I've been manually reconciling my receipts against my bank statements for years, but lately have gotten really bad at it (piles of receipts).

[The recent Equifax breach](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2017/09/equifax-data-breach-what-do) was a wake up call to get serious about it again.

So I've created a system (and program) called [ReceiptReconciliation](https://github.com/aolney/receipt-reconciliation) to partially automate the process.

Here's how it works:

1. As you buy things and get receipts, scan them with Office Lens and save to Word format. This will do OCR and save to OneDrive. You can even scan your computer screen for online purchases!
2. When you want to reconcile, log into OneDrive and download Documents\Office Lens, which contains all the receipts
3. Use pandoc to convert the docx Word files to txt. There is a script included so you can do this as a batch process. Run the script from the Office Lens receipt directory you downloaded.
4. Save a copy of your transactions spreadsheet as tab delimited
5. Run ReceiptReconciliation
